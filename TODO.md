# TODO for Fixing Button Issue in adminHomepage.js

## Steps to Complete:

1. **Analyze the Issue**: Confirmed that buttons in the options modal do not appear for device categories other than "display", "network", or "sensor" because functionalities array is empty for other categories. ✅

3. **Test the Changes**: Verify that the buttons now appear when clicking "Controls" for devices with other categories. (Ready for testing)
